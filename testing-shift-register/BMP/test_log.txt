first test: 
It seems to be working fine, but there must be more analysis. 
Waiting time was set to 2 cycle from 10. Top frequency was used. 
After the logaritmic part showed by saida, there were a wild 
    signal (something about 30 maybe 40 percent higher or lower 
    than the function setting point) until next RES.
