============First test: 

It seems to be working fine, but there must be more analysis. 
Waiting time was set to 2 cycle from 10. Top frequency was used. 
After the (1-e^(-t...)) part showed by saida, there were a wild 
    signal (something about 30 maybe 40 percent higher or lower 
    than the function setting point) until next RES.

Subtest: To the same level of light, write down the value almost
        at setting point of the function for the 'saida' output.
        Doing this for each cell (voltage):

        Cell 0 = 2.92V
        Cell 1 = 2.92V
        Cell 2 = 3.68V
        Cell 3 = 2.24V
        Cell 4 = 2.52V
        Cell 5 = 1.68V
        Cell 6 = 1.68V
        Cell 7 = 0.38...V (makes sense because it is the external 
                        - not connected)
